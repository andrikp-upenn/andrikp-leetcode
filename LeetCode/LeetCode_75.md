## 📌 Notes

- Solving in both **Python** and **C++** to reinforce both languages.
- Python first to focus on algorithmic thinking, C++ to reinforce systems-level understanding relevant to robotics.
- Each problem includes:
  - A clean solution with comments
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Both brute force and optimized approaches where applicable
  - A `README.md` inside the folder describing the problem and approach

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered So Far

- **HashMaps & Sets** — duplicate detection, frequency counting, fast lookups
- **Sorting** — using sorted fingerprints for anagram detection
- **Prefix & Suffix Products** — building cumulative products in O(n)
- **String Encoding** — length-prefixed delimiter design
- **2D Array Traversal** — row/col/box validation with sets
